# Basics of Neural Networks

There are many resources out there that provide details of artificial neural networks (ANNs), so I will keep things brief. ANNs are inspired by neurons in the brain. A Neuron receives some input and based on that input will turn on or off. Neurons have connections with many others, and therefore the action of turning on a single neuron may trigger another, creating a cascading, collective effect that inevitably leads to a final result. Instead of considering a binary case of neurons turning on and off, ANNs work on floating point values. If the problem we're trying to solve is classification, we must convert the final output to binary values (i.e. 1s and 0s). However, most cases in atomistic machine learning are regression problems. ANNs consist of `layers` and in each layer, the inputs get multiplied against the `weights` for that layer, a `bias` is added, and and a non-linear `activation` function is applied. The activation function is the necessary ingredient to learn non-linear mappings.
