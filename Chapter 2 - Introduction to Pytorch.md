# Introduction to Pytorch

In the previous chapter, we saw that `numpy` allows us to perform mathematical operations easily, and we don't have to deal with slow for loops. Pytorch builds on top of this, to allow these mathematical computations to happen on different devices. Examples of devices are CPUs and GPUs.
